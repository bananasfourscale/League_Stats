1. Title Screen
2. Games
    * Players/Teams can take in a Game object which contains the scores for
        Players/Teams and those stats from game are what is used to update
        metrics. 
3. Tournaments
    * ^^ same general idea as Games, but is a container for lists of games
4. Game Scrapper
    * Grab the results of games from <somewhere> and process based on Teams,
        same for the tournaments.
    * Stats which are compiled for multiple games are stored and updated at the
        same time that games are processed.
5. Statistics database
    * Need some way to keep track of my person stats for all the metrics.
6. Matplotlib+seaborn for graphical representation.
